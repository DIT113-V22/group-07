# Green Garbage

Project proposal
----------------

:video_game: What are you going to make?
---------------------------

For the project, we plan to create a game that raises awareness about high levels of waste in all sorts of environments where the user is manually controlling the garbage truck on an app. The vehicle can explore the area whilst clearing up objects that are waste and everything that is not waste will be left in simulation without change. With this being the minimum viable product and the scope having the possibility to expand in reference to features.

:deciduous_tree: Why will you make it? What problem does it solve?
-------------------------------------------------

*In 2015 all United Nations Member States joined together for sustainable development and future. In UNs Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible consumption and production, it presents the global “material footprint”, and it increased by 70% from 2000 to 2017. This needs to change.

With our educational game, we would like to raise awareness about waste pollution and the negative impact it has on the environment but in a fun way. In these current times, one can see trash of all materials lying on roads, parks, and nature reserves for years. This is to inspire more action and to encourage people to not litter as well as to clean up more in places they go by in their daily lives.


:articulated_lorry: How are you going to make it?
-----------------------------

We are planning to use a modded vehicle ([Garbage Truck](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/car-kit)) the form of a garbage truck that will be simulated in SMCE.
Using sensors to indicate when trash is collected and add it to the trash counter.
We will create an world that suits the environment we aim to have in the game.
Kotlin will be used to create the app and controller of the vehicle itself.
The app will give the gamer game instructions, educational context about waste and pollution and keep a track on how the game is going.
When the gamer is done playing, the gamer are able to store the result and check if the result got reasch the top 3. 

:chains: What kind of technology are you going to use?
---------------------------------------------

We will use Arduino IDE, Smartcar-Shield Library, SMCE, Kotlin, Java, CSS and a variety of other programming languages.
