Project proposal
----------------

:video_game: What are you going to make?
---------------------------

For the project, we plan to create a game that raises awareness about high levels of waste in our environment where the user is manually controlling the garbage truck on an app. The vehicle can explore the area whilst clearing up objects that are waste by collecting them upon detection and collision. We will use the app to communicate information about waste pollution.

:deciduous_tree: Why will you make it? What problem does it solve?
-------------------------------------------------

*In 2015 all United Nations Member States joined together for sustainable development and future. In UNs Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible consumption and production, it presents the global ‚Äúmaterial footprint‚Äù, and it increased by 70% from 2000 to 2017. This needs to change.

</p>

With our educational game, we would like to raise awareness about waste pollution and the negative impact it has on the environment but in a fun way. In these current times, one can see trash of all materials lying on roads, parks, and nature reserves for years. This is to inspire more action and to encourage people to not litter as well as to clean up more in places they go by in their daily lives.


:articulated_lorry: How are you going to make it?
-----------------------------

We are planning to use a modded vehicle ([Garbage Truck](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/car-kit)) the form of a garbage truck that will be simulated in SMCE.
We will create an world that suits the environment we aim to have in the game.
Kotlin will be used to create the app and controller of the vehicle itself.
The app will give the gamer game instructions, educational context about waste and pollution and keep a track on how the game is going.
When the gamer is done playing, the gamer are able to store the result and check if the result got reach the top 3. 

:chains: What kind of technology are you going to use?
---------------------------------------------

We will use Android Studio, Arduino IDE, Smartcar-Shield Library, SMCE, Kotlin, Godot and Blender.Diagram


üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture
---------------------------------------------
The truck has been composed with a variety of sensors such as gyroscope for basic orientation, ultrasensor to help with detection of obstacles and the infrared sensor is in place to detect certain close by objects. There has been basic implementation of the odometer and speedometer to calculate distance and speed.
