    <string name="edu_game">With our educational game, we would like to raise awareness about waste pollution and the negative impact it has on the environment, but in a fun way.</string>
    <string name="proposal">For the project, we plan to create a game that raises awareness about high levels of waste in all sorts of environments where the user is manually controlling the car on an app. The vehicle can explore the area whilst clearing up objects that are waste and everything that is not waste will be left in simulation without change.</string>
    <string name="UN2015">In 2015 all United Nations Member States joined together for sustainable development and future. In UNs Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible consumption and production, it presents the global “material footprint”, and it increased by 70 \% from 2000 to 2017.</string>

    <!--Recycle info string: -->
    <string name="plastic.tx">Plastic recycling is the reprocessing of plastic waste into new and useful products. When performed correctly, this can reduce dependence on landfill, conserve resources and protect the environment from plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nRecycling is necessary because almost all plastic is non-biodegradable and thus builds-up in the environment, where it can cause harm.</string>
    <string name="paper.tx">The environmental effects of paper are significant, which has led to changes in industry and behaviour at both business and personal levels. With the use of modern technology such as the printing press and the highly mechanized harvesting of wood, disposable paper became a relatively cheap commodity, which led to a high level of consumption and waste. The rise in global environmental issues such as air and water pollution, climate change, overflowing landfills and clearcutting have all lead to increased government regulations.</string>
    <string name="can.tx">A toxic heavy metal is any relatively dense metal or metalloid that is noted for its potential toxicity, especially in environmental contexts. The term has particular application to cadmium, mercury and lead, all of which appear in the World Health Organizations list of 10 chemicals of major public concern. Other examples include manganese, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, silver, antimony and thallium.</string>
    <string name="glass.tx">Circularity of glass can help minimize the use of raw materials (sand), generation of landfilled waste and pollution emissions. For every 10 \% increase in the amount of recycled glass, or cullet, that is used to make containers, CO2 emissions are reduced by 5 \% and the amount of energy needed goes down 3 \%</string>
    <string name="foodwaste.tx">Potential sources of compostable materials, or feedstocks, include residential, agricultural, and commercial waste streams. Residential food or yard waste can be composted at home, or collected for inclusion in a large-scale municipal composting facility. In some regions, it could also be included in a local or neighborhood composting project.</string>
