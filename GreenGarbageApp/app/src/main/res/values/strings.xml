    <string name="edu_game">With our educational game, we would like to raise awareness about waste pollution and the negative impact it has on the environment, but in a fun way.</string>
    <string name="proposal">For the project, we plan to create a game that raises awareness about high levels of waste in all sorts of environments where the user is manually controlling the car on an app. The vehicle can explore the area whilst clearing up objects that are waste and everything that is not waste will be left in simulation without change.</string>
